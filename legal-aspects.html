<p>When it comes to hacking, we need to clarify some aspects</p><br>

<b>Is hacking illegal?</b><br>

<p>The profession of ethical hacker is a legal, official, and highly paid job. Ethical hackers play a crucial role in a company. Their mission is to exploit, <span class="red">with the knowledge and approval of the owner</span>, the company's servers, websites, and other informations systems, to identify vulnerabilities and fix them before an unauthorized and malicious individual can find and exploit them in a manner that will damage the systems of the company or the users data.<br><br>


During penetration testing (pentesting), the cybersecurity professional responsible for offensive security (ethical hacker) must report the identified vulnerabilities and must not disclose informations about users or other confidential data found during the exploitation process. Therefore, for hacking to be legal, it must be conducted with the knowledge and approval of the system owner, and any discovered data must not be made public.<br><br>

<span class="red">However, hacking without the owner's knowledge and approval is illegal and can have legal consequences.</span></p><br>

<b>How can I practice hacking legally?</b><br><br>

There are several ways to practice hacking in a legal manner. First of all, you can use online resources. There are many websites specifically designed for penetration testing, intentionally created with various vulnerabilities to allow legal hacking practice. We will discuss these in our articles, depending on the type of vulnerability. Additionally, there are websites that offer numerous labs and CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges. Some of the most well-known include Hack The Box, Hack This Site, and Parrot CTF, among others.<br><br>

On these platforms, users can learn about cybersecurity, practice hacking skills legally, and even create their own challenges related to website or server hacking, with different difficulty levels and vulnerabilities.<br><br>

Furthermore, you can try penetration testing on your own devices, as not all hacking techniques cause damage. You can host a local website on your device to test authentication bypass, XSS, or other web vulnerabilities. You can also try to gain access to your own computer to understand how backdoor, reverse shells, or bind shells work.</p><br>



<b>Is it Legal to Hack a Hacker?</b><br>

<p>Hacking a hacker is illegal, as it involves unauthorized access to an information system. If your data or money has been stolen, you can report the incident to the police. Also, any information obtained by hacking a hacker cannot be used as evidence in court, as it was obtained illegally.<br><br>

<span class="red">It is important to mention that all the informations presented on this website are for educational purposes only</span> â€” to help understand how computer systems work, learn how to protect yourself online, write secure applications, and study cybersecurity for <b>legal and ethical practice</b>. Also, all the informations presented in this website are publicly available on many cybersecurity websites on the internet.</p>

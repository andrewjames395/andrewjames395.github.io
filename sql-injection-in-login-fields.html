<p>After learning in the previous articles how to install the Linux terminal on PC and Android, what the main commands in Linux are, how to use this operating system, as well as various legal aspects about hacking, in today's article it is time to move on to actual ethical hacking.<br>

<div class="note-box">Note: Hacking a server or website without the owner's consent is illegal. Hacking techniques can only be used legally in environments specifically designed for testing such skills, on your own devices, or in a setting where you have the owner's permission. Also, all of the informations presented here are publicly available on many cybersecurity websites on internet.</div><br><br>

The first technique we will talk about is called SQL Injection. By exploiting this type of vulnerability, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to a website's database and can execute commands that interact with the database. In this multi-part lesson, you will learn what SQL Injection is, how to legally exploit this vulnerability, and how to protect yourself against this type of attack.</p><br>

<div class="ad">
    <script type="text/javascript">
        aclib.runBanner({
            zoneId: '9737286',
        });
    </script>
</div><br>


<b>How does SQL Injection works</b><br>

<p>First of all, we need to understand that website databases are created using a programming language called SQL (Structured Query Language). As you probably already know, each programming language has its specific usage: HTML is used for creating websites, CSS for styling the content, JavaScript for creating scripts, PHP for the connection between websites and servers etc. Therefore, SQL is used for creating databases and managing the connection between a website and its database.<br><br>


Let's imagine that we have a website that has, in its database, the following table called "users", that contains the users's login informations:


    <div class="table-container">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>id</th>
                <th>username</th>
                <th>password</th>
                <th>city</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>john_doe</td>
                <td>password123</td>
                <td>New York</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>jane_smith</td>
                <td>qwerty456</td>
                <td>Los Angeles</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>mike_jones</td>
                <td>letmein789</td>
                <td>Chicago</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>anna_white</td>
                <td>securepass</td>
                <td>New York</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>chris_brown</td>
                <td>admin123</td>
                <td>Los Angeles</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div><br>

In the case of a login form, what the server sees is the following SQL query:<br><br>


<div class="code-box">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = <span style="white-space: nowrap;">' '</span> AND password = <span style="white-space: nowrap;">' '</span></div><br>

The explanation of the query in human language is: Select all from the "users" table where the value of the "username" column is <span style="white-space: nowrap;">' '</span> and the value of the "password" column is <span style="white-space: nowrap;">' '</span>.<br><br>

<div class="ad">
    <script type="text/javascript">
        aclib.runBanner({
            zoneId: '9737286',
        });
    </script>
</div><br


Now, let's enter a valid set of credentials: <br><br>
<div class="code-box2">Username: john_doe
Password: password123</div><br>

The SQL interrogation to the database in our case looks like this:<br><br>

<div class="code-box">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john_doe' AND password = 'password123'</div><br>

After that, the server compares the entered credentials with those stored in the database. It checks if the combination "john_doe:password123" exists in the users table. Since the provided credentials are correct, the interrogation will return the TRUE value, granting access to the website. Basically, the server asks the database: Does the username "john_doe" exists? TRUE! Does he has the password "password123"? TRUE! Then you can enter.<br><br>

If we enter incorrect credentials, such as "mary:123456", the query will look like this:<br><br>

<div class="code-box">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'mary' AND password = '123456'</div><br>

Since this combination does not exist in the database, the interrogation will return the FALSE value, and we will not be able to log in.<br><br>

<div class="ad">
    <script type="text/javascript">
        aclib.runBanner({
            zoneId: '9737286',
        });
    </script>
</div><br>


SQL Injection is based on the modification of the input fields, to manipulate the TRUE or FALSE values from the database interogation. As we saw earlier, for a successful login, the query must return the TRUE value. But what if, instead of entering the correct credentials (which we may not know), we close the username/password field (whose name the server search for in the database), and open another field where we enter a correct mathematical relation or another type of equality, making the server to choose the second value. Thus, our input will looks like this:<br><br>

<div class="code-box2">Username: mary' OR '1'='1
Password: 123456' OR '1'='1</div><br>

Now, the interrogation becomes:<br><br>

<div class="code-box">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'mary' OR '1'='1' AND password = '123456' OR '1'='1'</div><br>

Thus, the server checks whether the user "mary" exists or if 1=1. Since 1=1 is always TRUE, the result of the query for the username field will be TRUE. The same applies to the password field, where the server checks whether the password is "123456" or if 1=1. Since the query result is TRUE, we will be able to log into the website. With such an input, the login will be performed in the account of the the first user in the database (usually the administrator).<br><br>

<div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        aclib.runBanner({
            zoneId: '9737286',
        });
    </script>
</div><br>


There are several methods to exploit this vulnerability. In SQL, to mark a line of code that should be ignored by the programming language when executing the query (like a comment in human language created by the programmer that should not be considered by the program), we use -- (two minuses). Thus, everything that follows on that line after -- will be ignored by SQL (similar to the # in Python or PHP). The user can enter the following input:<br><br>

<div class="code-box2">Username: a' OR '1='1' --
Password: 123456</div><br>


In this case, the SQL query will look like this:<br><br>

<div class="code-box">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'a' OR '1'='1' <span style="color: gray;">--' AND password = '123456'</span></div><br>

The query for checking the password, being after the --, will be completely ignored. Thus, by using this tactic, the attacker can log in to the page of a user by only knowing the username, with the password no longer being necessary. An input like:<br><br>

<div class="code-box2">Username: john_doe' --
Password: doesntmatter</div><br>

Will produce the following SQL interrogation:<br><br>

<div class="code-box">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john_doe' <span style="color: gray;">--' AND password = 'doesntmatter'</span></div><br>

<div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        aclib.runBanner({
            zoneId: '9737286',
        });
    </script>
</div><br>


Practically speaking, it this case, the server only verify if the username is ok, then it let you in. Depending on how the interrogation is created, many times we have to use # instead of --, but we will discuss this in another article. Also, we can connect to a specific account based on its ID in the database. In general, the column containing the user ID is named "id". This column is automatically created by the database. Essentially, it represents the user's number in the order in which the account was created (the first user will be assigned ID 1, the second one ID 2, and so on). <br><br>

Exploiting this, an attacker could try to enter the following input:<br><br>

<div class="code-box2">Username: a' OR id=2 --
Password: doesntmatter</div><br>

An input like this will log the attacker in the account of the second user in the database, in our case jane_smith. We can continue with the testing, and instead of using "id," we can use other columns from the table. For this, we need to know the column names, although they can often be guessed using the registration form. We can input:<br><br>


<div class="code-box2">Username: a' OR city='Los Angeles' --
Password: doesntmatter</div><br>


Using such credentials will log us into the account of the first user in the database who lives in Los Angeles, in our case jane_smith. Additionally, we can log in even if we only know the password but not the username by entering:<br><br>

<div class="code-box2">Username: a' OR '1'='1
Password: letmein789</div><br>

There are countless combinations like this that we can use. Moreover, in the case of a website vulnerable to SQL Injection, an attacker can do much more than just log into different user accounts. They can execute commands in the database, such as adding new users, changing existing passwords, deleting users, or even wiping the entire table. In this scenario, SQL programming knowledge is an advantage. However, even without programming skills, this is not a problem, as there are tools that can automate the process.<br><br>

It is also very important that, when legally exploiting an SQLi vulnerability, our input to be syntactically correct (e.g., avoiding misplaced apostrophes or incorrect syntax), to ensure a successful connection.</p><br>

<div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        aclib.runBanner({
            zoneId: '9737286',
        });
    </script>
</div><br>


<b>How do I test for SQL Injection</b><br>

<p>To check if a login field is vulnerable to SQL Injection, you can enter an apostrophe in one of the fields or use another character that interacts with SQL logic (such as ;, ', or "). If, after pressing the login button, you receive an output like "SQL Syntax Error", then the site is most likely vulnerable.</p><br>

<b>Where can I practice SQLi attack legally</b><br>

<p>Beside the well-known cybersecurity online platforms like Hack The Box, Hack This Site or Parrot CTF, which contains many labs, there are several websites on the internet where this technique can be legally practiced. One of them is <a href="http://altoro.testfire.net"><span class="blue-link">altoro.testfire.net</span></a>, which simulates a banking website and is intentionally designed to be vulnerable to SQL Injection.<br><br>

Another is <a href="https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/#/"><span class="blue-link">juice-shop.herokuapp.com</span></a>, which simulates a juice shop and is intentionally built with multiple types of vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection in the login fields.<br><br>

There are also some labs on in-login-fields SQL Injection on <a href ="https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/lab-login-bypass"><span class="blue-link">portswigger.com</span></a>. This, being a big cybersecurity website, you will need a account to access the labs.</p><br>

</div><br>



<b>How common is the SQLi vulnerability in login fields today?</b><br>

<p>Even if SQL injection is one of the most common vulnerability, however, in the current year, this type of SQLi (in login field injection) is very difficult to find. It may still be encountered on older websites that have not been maintained or maybe on websites from less developed countries, but human error can occur anywhere.<br><br>

In the next article, we will discuss a much more common vulnerability today: SQL Injection in URLs. We will also use special tools to legally extract the content of its tables.</p><br>

<h2>Linux commands</h2><br>

<p>The Linux terminal may seem complicated at first, especially for someone used to the graphical interface of Windows, which consists of icons. Although Linux OS also has a graphical interface similar to Windows (with icons too), in the process of ethical hacking we will focus more on the terminal. The Linux terminal is similar to PowerShell or CMD on Windows, and someone who has used these two applications before may find several similarities between them. So, to use Linux, you need to know certain commands. <p> <br>

<b>1. whoami</b> <br>

<p>As the name suggests ("who am I"), this command prints the username of the current user. For example, running the whoami command on Android Linux Userland app, it will print "userland", while on a PC, it will display your username (the one you set up when you configured the system). This command is also used in the pentesting (penetration testing) process, to check whether, after carrying out an attack, the ethical hacker has successfully connected to the system as a specific user.</p><br>

<b>2. pwd</b> <br>

<p>The pwd command (print working directory) displays the path of the folder you are currently in.</p>

<p>Just like on Windows, Linux operates on a system of folders and subfolders. Taking Windows as an initial example, the home directory (the one you access when you open your PC) is Desktop, which is essentially a folder. Running the pwd command in Windows CMD in the Desktop folder would produce an output like: C:\Users\John\Desktop .Similarly, on Linux, running pwd in the home directory would return something like: /home/john or /home/userland (for Userland on Android). </p>

<p>If you have another folder inside your home directory, for example, notes, then running pwd while inside that folder will return: /home/john/notes . </p><br>

<b>3. ls</b> <br>

<p>The ls command (list) displays the contents of the current folder, showing the files in white and the subfolders in blue. </p>

<p>There are different variations of this command, such as: ls -a (list all) – Shows all files, including hidden ones or ls -l (long listing format) – Displays files along with their properties, such as creation date, permissions, size, etc. </p><br>

<b>4. mkdir</b> <br>

<p>The mkdir command (make directory) will create a directory in the current location. So, for exemple, running mkdir notes will create a directory named notes in the folder you are in.</p><br>

<b>5. cd</b> <br>

<p>The cd (change directory) command allows the user to navigate into a specific folder. Just like on Windows, where you double click a folder to open it, on Linux you use the cd command you access it. For exemple, to enter the notes folder, you run cd notes. Once inside the folder, you run ls to display its content (the content do not automatically appear when you enter the folder). <br>

There are more versions of this command. The simple cd command (without specifying a folder name) will take you to the home directory (/home/username). Also, the cd .. command will move you one folder back. For exemple, if you are in /home/john/notes folder and enter cd .., you will go to /home/john. Entering again the same command, you will enter /home directory. </p><br>

<b>6. cat</b><br>

<p>The cat command will display the contents of a file. For example, if we have a file named informations.txt, the command cat informations.txt will show its content in the terminal.</p><br>

<b>7. nano</b><br>

<p>Nano is a text editing tool. While the cat command displays the content of a file in the terminal (without allowing editing), nano allows us to create and edit files.</p>

<p>First, we need to check if nano is installed by typing nano in the terminal. If it’s not installed, we can install it using sudo apt install nano. Once installed, we can open nano (enter nano in the terminal) to create a new file, enter text, and close it by pressing CTRL+X, then Y to save, and finally entering the file name and pressing ENTER.<br>

To edit an existing file, we type nano followed by the file name nano informations.txt. After making changes, we close with CTRL+X, confirm saving with Y, and press ENTER.</p><br>

<b>8. rm</b><br>

<p>The rm command (remove) deletes a file. For example, the command rm informations.txt will delete the file informations.txt.<br>

Warning: The rm command only works for deleting files, not folders!</p><br>

<b>9. rmdir</b><br>

<p>The rmdir (remove directory) command deletes an empty folder. For example, rmdir notes will delete the notes folder, but only if it is empty. To delete a folder that contains files, use rm -r folder_name.</p><br>

<b>10. cp</b><br>

<p>The cp command (copy) copies a file from one location to another. For example, if we have the file "todolist.txt" in the /home/john/notes folder and want to copy it to /home/john/important, we use the command cp location_from location_to. In our case:<br><br>

cp /home/john/notes/todolist.txt /home/john/important<br><br>

This will create a copy of todolist.txt in the important folder while keeping the original file in the notes folder.<br><br>

IMPORTANT: When working with file paths, it’s important to know that if the file is in the directory you are currently in, you can simply use its name without specifying the full path (/home/user/...).<br><br>

Also, if the file is in a nearby directory, you can use .. (one directory back) to simplify the path.<br><br>

For example, if we are in the "important" directory, our previous command could be written as: cp todolist.txt ../important<br><br>

Also, we can change the name of the copied file: cp todolist.txt ../important/renamed.txt. This command you copy the file with a different name.</p><br>

<b>11. mv</b><br>

<p>The mv command move the file from a place to another. The usage is similar to the cp command: mv location_from location_to. </p>

<b>12. ifconfig</b><br>

<p>The ifconfig command displays network information, including the IP address. It is the Linux equivalent of ipconfig on Windows. If the command doesn’t work, you may need to install net-tools using: sudo apt install net-tools.</p><br>

<b>13. wget</b><br>

<p>The wget command download a file from internet. Usage exemple: wget https://mywebsite.com/file.txt</p><br>

<b>14. sudo</b><br>

<p>The sudo command (super user do) run a command as root.</p>

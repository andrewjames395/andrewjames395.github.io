<h2>Linux commands</h2><br>

<p>The Linux terminal may seem complicated at first, especially for someone used to the graphical interface of Windows, which consists of icons. Although Linux OS also has a graphical interface similar to Windows (with icons too), in the process of ethical hacking we will focus more on the terminal. The Linux terminal is similar to PowerShell or CMD on Windows, and someone who has used these two applications before may find several similarities between them. So, to use Linux, you need to know certain commands. <p> <br><br>

<b>1. whoami</b> <br>

As the name suggests ("who am I"), this command prints the username of the current user. For example, running the whoami command on Android Linux Userland app, it will print "userland", while on a PC, it will display your username (the one you set up when you configured the system). This command is also used in the pentesting (penetration testing) process, to check whether, after carrying out an attack, the ethical hacker has successfully connected to the system as a specific user.<br>

<b>2. pwd</b> <br>

<p>The pwd command (print working directory) displays the path of the folder you are currently in.</p>

<p>Just like on Windows, Linux operates on a system of folders and subfolders. Taking Windows as an initial example, the home directory (the one you access when you open your PC) is Desktop, which is essentially a folder. Running the pwd command in Windows CMD in the Desktop folder would produce an output like: C:\Users\John\Desktop .Similarly, on Linux, running pwd in the home directory would return something like: /home/john or /home/userland (for Userland on Android). </p>

<p>If you have another folder inside your home directory, for example, notes, then running pwd while inside that folder will return: /home/john/notes . </p>

<b>3. ls</b> <br>

<p>The ls command (list) displays the contents of the current folder, showing the files in white and the subfolders in blue. </p>

<p>There are different variations of this command, such as: ls -a (list all) – Shows all files, including hidden ones or ls -l (long listing format) – Displays files along with their properties, such as creation date, permissions, size, etc. </p>

<b>4. mkdir</b> <br>

<p>The mkdir command (make directory) will create a directory in the current location. So, for exemple, running mkdir notes will create a directory named notes in the folder you are in.</p>

<b>5. cd</b> <br>

<p>The cd (change directory) command allows the user to navigate into a specific folder. Just like on Windows, where you double click a folder to open it, on Linux you use the cd command you access it. For exemple, to enter the notes folder, you run cd notes. Once inside the folder, you run ls to display its content (the content do not automatically appear when you enter the folder). </p>

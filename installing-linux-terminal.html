            <p>Hacking is generally performed on Linux operating systems. This is because Linux is an open-source operating system, easily customizable, and most of the hacking programs (called tools) are made specifically for this OS. <br><br>
            If you do not have Linux OS installed on your laptop or PC, we can install the Linux terminal on both Windows and Android. The process is very simple and does not take more than two minutes.</p><br>

            <b>Installing Linux terminal on Windows</b>

            <p>On your PC, go to <b>Control Panel</b> > <b>Programs</b> > <b>Turn Windows features on and off</b>. In the list that appears, check <b>Windows Subsystem for Linux</b> (it's towards the end of the list). Click OK and restart your PC.
After restarting, go to the Microsoft Store and install the Kali Linux or Ubuntu application (there are several versions available for Ubuntu). <br><br>
            
After installation, the Kali/Ubuntu app will configure itself, and after that it will ask you to create a username and a password. Be sure to set up a password that you can remember, because without it you won't be able to install tools, or to run commands as administrator (called "root" in Linux).</p><br>

<b>Installing Linux terminal on Android</b> <br>
            <p>On Android, things are even simpler. All you have to do is to install the Userland app from the Play Store. After installation, open it, and from the Apps menu select Kali. On Userland, there is no need to configure the username and password, having the default username "userland", and the password is not required. </p><br>

<b>Final configuration</b><br>

            <p>After you have installed the Linux terminal, both on the PC and on Android it is necessary to update the system, to bring all its functionalities up to date. This is a very important step, because without it you won't be able to install programs. All you have to do is to enter <span class="boxed-text">sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade</span> in the terminal. On the PC, it will ask you to enter the password, while on Android it will run directly. This command, which consists of two commands ("sudo apt update" and "sudo apt upgrade"), will update your system. <br><br>

After completing these steps, you will be ready to use the Linux terminal on Windows and Android. </p>
